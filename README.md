# sh_quake
**A place for Quake 1 textures and stuff**

## Textures
### Naming convention
All textures follow naming convention like this: sh_<set><thing><number>, where:
* sh_ is prefix for all textures, taken from my name
* <set> is optional, stands for type of texture set / family
* <thing> is texture name, what it exactly is
* <number> starts from 1
  
Examples:
sh_dwood1 - d stands for dead, so it's dead wood :).
  
This silly convenction is used because of limited number of characters in texture names. Al least you have easy way to filter them :).
